# StarMap Navigation

## For this university project, I implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm in a star-map navigation simulation using Unity. The system includes custom pathfinding and movement methods, applying mathematical techniques learned during the module.

Features:<br/>
🤖 AI Navigation – Intelligent movement through the star-map.<br/>
🗺️ Route Plotting – Visual representation of the optimal path.<br/>
🔍 Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Pathfinding – Efficient shortest-path calculations.<br/>
